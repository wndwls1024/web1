<strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank title="html5 specification>(CNN)</a> - </strong>A British woman has been sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for pretending to be a 16-year-old boy in order to groom and sexually abuse young girls.
Gemma Watts, 21, pleaded guilty to seven charges of <u>grooming</u> and sexual assault in November 2019 and returned to Winchester Crown Court for sentencing Friday, according to a police statement.
Watts pretended to be a boy called "Jake Watton" to groom and sexually assault her victims.
"In this particular case, Watts targeted her young victims on social media platforms and duped them into believing they were entering into a relationship with someone whom they could trust," said Phillipa Kenwright of London's Metropolitan Police force, who was one of the lead detectives on the case.

Police found that Jake Watton was in fact Gemma Watts, and later discovered another two victims, both under the age of 18, who reported being groomed and sexually assaulted by someone using that name.
Watts was arrested in July 2018 following a search of her home. She admitted to groom</p>
